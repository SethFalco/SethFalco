## About Me

I'm inspired by the idea of working collaboratively to push open technology forward. I want to live in a world where there is software for everything, freely accessible to everyone.

Everything I do is contributed to open-source projects; ideally free from cost, tracking, and advertising. I primarily develop and maintain software, and love contributing to projects that I find interesting or depend on.

## Achievements

* Writer for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/seth/) with 95,000+ page views.
* Visual Studio Code extension developer with 10,000+ installs.

## Career

My ideals align well with non-profits and open-source, so I incorporated [Elypia](https://elypia.org/), a [Community Interest Company (CIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) that's looking to: 

* Create open-source software for industries with only proprietary, or legacy options available.
* Develop software to lower the level of entry into particular industries.
* Promote education by providing a bridge to enterprise tools and libraries with smaller use-cases.
