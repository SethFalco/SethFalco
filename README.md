## About Me

I work collaboratively to push open technology forward, and want to live in a world where there's software for everything, freely accessible by everyone. We should no longer only solve problems, just to hinder access to solutions.

Everything I do is contributed to open-source projects, ideally free from cost, tracking, and advertising. I primarily develop and maintain software, and love contributing to projects that I find interesting or depend on.

## Notable Achievements / Contributions

* Writer for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/seth/) with 150,000+ page views.
* Visual Studio Code extension developer with 20,000+ installs.
* Produced a corpus for [OPUS](https://opus.nlpl.eu/tldr-pages.php) from [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

## Available for Work

I'm available to hire on a contract-basis, and willing to accept a variety of projects:

* Resolve bugs or feature requests in an open-source project (i.e. upstream dependency).
* Learn and contribute to technical documentation for inadequately documented software.
* Significant feature developments and integrations for open-source projects I maintain.
* Larger projects from the ground up.

## Career

My ideals align with non-profits, so I incorporated Elypia, a [community interest company (CIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) with the mission to: 

* Develop, contribute to, and promote the adoption of free and open-source software.
* Support industries with only proprietary or legacy software available, to migrate to or create open-source alternatives.
