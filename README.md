## About Me

I work collaboratively to push open technology forward, and want to live in a world where there's software for everything, freely accessible by everyone. We should no longer only solve problems, just to hinder access to solutions.

Most of what I do is contributed to open-source projects, ideally free from cost, tracking, and advertising.

## Notable Achievements

* Writer for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/seth/) with 150,000+ page views.

## Available to Contract

I'm available for contract work, and willing to accept a variety of projects:

* Resolve bugs or feature requests in open-source software, such as upstream dependencies.
* Learn about and improve technical documentation for open-source software.
* Significant feature developments and integrations for open-source software I maintain.
* You get the idea! I want open-source software to be useful to you. If you need help maintaining open-source software, or need help incorporating open-source software into your workflow, hit me up.
