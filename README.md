## About Me
I'm inspired by the idea of working collaboratively as a community to push open
technology forward. I want to live in a world where there is software for
everything, freely accesible to everyone.

The [Open Source Initiative][osi] and [Creative Commons][creative-commons] are
especially interesting to me, and have led me to dedicate my future to the
community interest.

Everything I do is contributed to community focused projects; ideally free from
cost, free from tracking or advertising, and open-source. I primarily develop
and maintain software, and love contributing to open-source projects that I find
interesting or depend on for my own projects.

## Career
My ideals and values align well with software development, so I incorporated
[Elypia][elypia-website], a [community interest company (CIC)][wikipedia-cic]
that's looking to: 

* Develop software to lower the level of entry into particular industries.
* Create open-source software for industries with only proprietary, or legacy
  options available.
* Promote education by providing a bridge to enterprise tools and libraries
  with smaller use-cases.
