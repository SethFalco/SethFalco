I'm in love with the idea of trying to work collaboratively as a community to push technology forward and promote innovation.

The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) and [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) are especially interesting to me, and I've decided to dedicate my future around these and the values they hold.

Thanks to this, I've created and am the managing director of a non-profit [community interest company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) (CIC) in the UK called [Elypia](https://elypia.org/). Elypia's goal is develop free and open-source software for everyone. More specifically we're interested in developing software that can help lower the level of entry into particular industries and make them more affordable, or make learning easier by providing a bridge to enterprise tools and libraries with smaller use-cases.

If any of this interests you, please feel free to check out the [@elypia](https://github.com/elypia/) organization on GitHub or visit our website [here](https://elypia.org/). Almost everything I do outside of open-source contributions to third-party repositories lives here. As a non-profit, funds are always looking painful, so if anything we do is of interest to you, or aids you in your aspirations, feel free to [donate](https://elypia.org/donate)!

While I don't play much anymore, I'm quite keen on video games and and sometimes join my partner while she's streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/JenTheBluePanda)!
