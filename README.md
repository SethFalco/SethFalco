## About Me

I work collaboratively to push open technology forward, and want to live in a world where there's software for everything, freely accessible by everyone. We should no longer only solve problems, just to hinder access to solutions.

Most of what I do is contributed to open-source projects, ideally free from cost, tracking, and advertising. I primarily develop and maintain software, and love contributing to projects that I find interesting or depend on.

## Notable Achievements / Contributions

* Writer for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/seth/) with 150,000+ page views.
* Visual Studio Code extension author with 20,000+ installs.
* Created [tldr-translation-pairs-gen](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-translation-pairs-gen), to produce a [parralel corpus](https://opus.nlpl.eu/tldr-pages/corpus/version/tldr-pages) from [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

## Available for Work

I'm available to hire on a contract-basis, and willing to accept a variety of projects:

* Resolve bugs or feature requests in an open-source project (i.e. upstream dependency).
* Learn and contribute to technical documentation for inadequately documented software.
* Significant feature developments and integrations for open-source projects I maintain.
* Larger projects from the ground up.
