# Projects
Everything I do is contributed to the [@elypia](https://github.com/elypia/) organization,
or other open-source projects that I or Elypia depend on. If you're interested in the projects
I maintain, please check Elypia, or my contribution history which includes contributions to
other repositories.

# About Me
I'm inspired by the idea of working collaboratively as a community to push open technology forward and promote innovation.

The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) and [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) are especially of interest to me, and has led me to dedicate my future to the community interest.

While I don't play much anymore, I'm also quite keen on video games and sometimes join my partner while she's streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/JenTheBluePanda)! 

# Career
My ideals and values align perfectly with software development, so I incorporated and am now directing a non-profit [community interest company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) (CIC) in the UK called [Elypia](https://elypia.org/). Elypia's goal is to develop free and open-source software for everyone. 

We're interested in:
* Developing software that can help lower the level of entry into particular industries.
* Developing applications for free availability for specialized industries that only have paid, proprietary, or legacy options available.
* Promoting education by providing a bridge to enterprise tools and libraries with smaller use-cases.

If any of the above interests you, please feel free to check out the [@elypia](https://github.com/elypia/) organization on GitHub or visit our website [here](https://elypia.org/). Almost everything I do outside of contributions to third-party open-source repositories lives here. As a non-profit, funds are always looking painful, so if anything we do is of interest to you, or aids you in your aspirations, feel free to [donate](https://elypia.org/donate)!
