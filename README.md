## About Me

I work collaboratively to push open technology forward, and want to live in a world where there's software for everything, freely accessible by everyone. We should no longer only solve problems just to hinder access to solutions.

Most of what I do is contributed to Open Source projects, ideally free from cost, tracking, and advertising.

## Notable Achievements

* Writer for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/sethfalco/) with 200,000+ page views.
* [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elypia.magick-image-reader) author with 25,000+ installs.
* [Thunderbird add-on](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/user/SethFalco/) with 150+ daily active users.
* Created [tldr-translation-pairs-gen](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-translation-pairs-gen), to produce a [parallel corpus](https://opus.nlpl.eu/tldr-pages/corpus/version/tldr-pages) from [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

## Personal Projects

All of my personal projects are maintained on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/SethFalco). I only use [GitHub](https://github.com/SethFalco) to contribute to Open Source and to maintain software that was already on GitHub before.
